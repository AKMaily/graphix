This repository contains a minimal Website to linearize graphic structures that where uploaded via a config.json. 
It can be used to linearize knowledge in a linear order or learn topics in a linear order. 
Each node contains a topic, a status, as well as a link to a webpage containing important information about that specific topic. 
Graphs can be edited in the website. Graphs are stored temporary in the browser but can also be exported into a config format.

The physic2.json is an example for such a config.
